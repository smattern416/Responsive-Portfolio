      <p>Heyo my name is Stephanie Mattern. I was born and raised here in Orlando, did my undergrad in Tampa at USF and then moved out to the Mile High city for 5 1/2 years. </p>
      <p>I am obsessed with my dog, Tylie, who is a 15 year old Cockapoo. I really enjoy spending time with my family & friends, eating really good food, fashion and British procedurals. 
        Another passion of mine is travel. I studied abroad in Italy while I was in college and fell in love with traveling. </p> 
        <p>My interests and passions are a huge reason for me taking this bootcamp and pursuing this new career. I want a career that allows me the option to work remotely (while abroad) and provides more time for the good stuff in life. 
          I'm looking forward to learning about this entirely new world of web development and all of the opportunities ahead.
